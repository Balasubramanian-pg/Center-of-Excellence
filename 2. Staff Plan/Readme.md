# What is staff planning?

Staff planning, also sometimes referred to as workforce planning, is understanding and managing an organization’s personnel requirements. This involves:
- The number of employees a company needs
- The type of employees a company needs 

The aim is to make sure you aren’t under- or overstaffed, maximize employee satisfaction, and build or maintain the right skill set to achieve company goals.

Typically, companies undertake staff planning at the start of a new budget cycle or a new project. Its scope can be all-encompassing — covering staff from the full organization — or a specific team or department. 

Regardless of when you go into personnel planning or what the scope is, it’s essential to understand that it’s not a one-and-done process. Instead, staff planning is related to proactively maintaining a living document specifying an organization’s current skillset and staff requirements.
