# **Praxis Framework: Part 3 - Competence**

## **3.1 Overview**

### **Three Groups of Competencies in Praxis**
*   **Delivery competencies:** These are based on the functions described in section 3.3.
*   **Process competencies:** These are based on the individual processes defined in Part 2 of the framework.
*   **Interpersonal competencies:** These are addressed in the corresponding sections of Part 1.

### **Adapting and Tailoring Competencies**
*   Each function or process has only one competency, which must be adapted to the specific situation where it is applied.
*   This means a competency must be aligned with the complexity and environment of the work, and whether it is being managed as a project, programme, or portfolio.
*   Indicative suggestions for tailoring are included with each competency, but these are not exhaustive.

### **Alignment with the Capability Maturity Model**
*   The level of individual performance described in these competencies is aligned with **Level 2** in the capability maturity model, which requires competent staff.
*   The competencies are primarily aimed at a P3 Manager role and will need adaptation for other roles like Sponsor, Assurance, or Support.
*   The maturity model provides the organizational context in which these individual competencies are applied.

### **Relationship to Other Parts of the Praxis Framework**
*   **Part 1 (Knowledge)** and **Part 2 (Method)** provide the overall structure for the competency framework.
*   In return, the performance criteria defined within these competencies provide benchmarks for assessing individual performance.

### **Structure of Each Competency**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   This section lists the specific goals that the competency is designed to achieve.
*   **Performance criteria:**
    *   These describe what a person must effectively do to be considered competent in achieving the goals.
*   **Knowledge and understanding:**
    *   This outlines the relevant principles, procedures, tools, and techniques a person must know and understand to effectively demonstrate the performance criteria.

## **3.2 Management Competencies**

*   This section includes competencies that relate to the management functions described in Part 1.
*   The context functions generally do not have corresponding competencies, with one exception: the sponsorship function. The competency for the sponsorship process also covers the sponsorship function.
*   These competencies are divided into two types:
    *   **Delivery Competencies (Section 3.3)**
    *   **Interpersonal Competencies (Section 3.4)**

## **3.3 Delivery Competencies**

*   Delivery competencies align with the delivery functions from Part 1.
*   The titles reflect the practical application of these functions. For example, the competency is 'Manage stakeholders,' which is the application of the function 'stakeholder management.'

### **3.3.1 Provide assurance**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To review management planning.
    *   To monitor the effectiveness of functions and processes.
    *   To give stakeholders confidence that the work is being managed effectively and efficiently.
*   **Performance criteria - You must be able to:**
    *   P1 plan and initiate assurance.
    *   P2 review the design and implementation of life cycle-based processes.
    *   P3 review the design and implementation of management plans.
    *   P4 audit the performance of quality control activities and review any resulting corrective action.
    *   P5 maintain assurance documentation.
    *   P6 communicate the outcomes of assurance to stakeholders.
*   **Knowledge and understanding - You need to know and understand:**
    *   K1 the goals of assurance.
    *   K2 responsibilities for assurance.
    *   K3 the context of the work and its impact on assurance.
    *   K4 assurance procedures and techniques.
    *   K5 the purpose and content of assurance documentation.
    *   K6 the principles of the P3 functions and processes being assured.
    *   K7 how to adapt assurance throughout the life cycle.
    *   K8 how to communicate assurance outcomes to stakeholders.

> **Tailoring Note:** This competency can be applied internally or externally. For external assurance, it would include checking internal assurance. In high-risk or regulated environments, the knowledge criteria may be expanded to include specific assurance techniques.

## **3.4 Interpersonal Competencies**

*   Interpersonal competencies align with the interpersonal functions in Part 1.
*   The titles reflect the practical application; for example, 'Manage conflict' is the application of 'conflict management.'
*   These competencies are not unique to P3 management but are focused on how these skills need to be implemented within the P3 context.

### **3.4.1 Communicate**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To impart relevant information.
    *   To ensure the information is understood.

*   The titles reflect practical application; for example, 'Identify a project or programme' is the enactment of the 'identification process.'

### **3.5.1 Identify a project or programme**
*   **Objectives:**
    *   To develop an outline of the project or programme and assess whether it is likely to be justifiable.
    *   To determine what effort and investment is needed to define the work in detail.

    *   K6 the purpose and content of a brief and definition plan.
    *   K7 how assurance applies to the process.

> **Tailoring Note:** This process may be omitted if a client or parent programme has already performed the identification. However, it is a key competency for any manager to have.


*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent process competencies from 3.5.2 to 3.5.10, including Sponsor a project or programme, Define a project or programme, Deliver a project or programme (and its sub-competency), Manage boundaries, Close a project or programme, Realise benefits, Initiate a portfolio, Govern a portfolio, Manage a portfolio, and Co-ordinate projects and programmes, detailing their Objectives, Performance criteria, and Knowledge and understanding as provided in the original text.)*

# **Praxis Framework: Part 4 - Capability Maturity**

## **4.1 Overview of Capability Maturity**

### **Purpose of a Capability Maturity Model**

*   A capability maturity model provides guidance for an organization to improve its ability to deliver projects, programmes, and portfolios effectively and efficiently.

### **Two Ways to View Capability Maturity**

*   **Internal View:**
    *   This perspective focuses on developing the organization's internal abilities.
    *   The goal is for more projects and programmes to successfully deliver their objectives (effectiveness).
    *   It also aims to reduce wasted investment (efficiency).
    *   A significant benefit comes from simply examining internal processes and embedding them into the organization's culture.
    *   Even a basic model can spark improvement, but a more appropriate model leads to more stable and effective results.

*   **External View:**
    *   This perspective is about providing reassurance to external stakeholders.
    *   For example, a customer investing in a project delivered by a third party will have more confidence if that third party has a demonstrably high level of capability maturity.
    *   This requires a way to compare the capability maturity of different organizations, meaning they should be assessed against the same model.

### **The Praxis Approach to Capability Maturity**

*   **Balancing Consistency and Flexibility:**
    *   The ideal use of a capability maturity model is one that allows for external comparison while also being flexible enough to adapt to the unique context of each organization's project, programme, and portfolio (P3) management.

*   **Core Principle of Praxis:**
    *   Praxis is built on the idea that P3 management is a set of components that are assembled and tailored for each unique piece of work.
    *   The Praxis capability maturity model is designed to be flexible for different contexts but consistent enough for comparison between organizations.

*   **How it Works:**
    *   The model uses high-level attributes to describe different maturity levels. These attributes are supplemented with advice on how to apply them.
    *   This approach is similar to ISO 9000, where an organization develops a quality system for its specific context but can still be accredited to a universal standard if it aligns with the core principles.
    *   The high-level attributes should always be understood in conjunction with the corresponding function, especially when considering the differences between projects, programmes, and portfolios.

*   **Adapting the CMMIÂ® Model:**
    *   The Praxis model adapts principles from the CMMIÂ® model by using separate measures for **capability** and **maturity**.

### **Structure of the Praxis Model**

*   **Capability (The Columns):**
    *   This side of the model follows the structure of the functional framework.
    *   Capability can be developed and assessed for each function individually.
    *   An organization identifies the functions relevant to its context and develops its capability in those areas.

*   **Maturity (The Rows):**
    *   Maturity is achieved by developing capability in the necessary functions and then implementing life cycle processes that use those functions in an integrated way.
    *   Maturity increases by first developing capability in relevant functions and then embedding the appropriate methods (project, programme, or portfolio).

### **Relationship to Other Parts of the Praxis Framework**

*   The capability maturity model's structure is derived from **Part 1 (Knowledge)** and **Part 2 (Method)**.
*   In return, the model provides a standard development path for an organization's functions and processes.
*   Achieving Level 2 capability and maturity requires competent people. The competencies described in **Part 3 (Competence)** are therefore pitched at this level, providing an organizational context for individual development.

## **4.2 Capability**

To achieve a specific level of capability for a function, an organization must meet both the generic goals and the specific goals for that function. These goals are cumulative; for instance, to reach level 3 in risk management, an organization must have achieved all goals for levels 2 and 3.

### **Defining the Capability Levels**

*   **Level 0:** The function is rarely or never performed as described in Part 1. This represents a complete lack of formal P3 management.
*   **Level 1:** The function's goals are achieved in an ad-hoc manner, typically through the hard work of a few talented individuals.
*   **Level 2:** The goals are consistently achieved using competent people (as described in Part 3). P3 management is effective but could be more efficient.
*   **Level 3:** The organization coordinates P3 management to gain efficiencies and ensures good practices are consistent and embedded in the culture.

### **4.2.1 Generic Goals and Attributes (Apply to All Functions)**

## **4.3 Maturity**

### **The Praxis View of Maturity Levels**

Praxis views maturity differently from many models. It's not just about executing every process more rigorously. There are fundamental differences between immature and mature organizations.

*   **Level 0:** The organization does not formally recognize projects, programmes, or portfolios. Management is intuitive and unstructured.
*   **Level 1:** The organization recognizes P3 management, but goals are achieved through individual effort and heroics, not a formal approach.
*   **Level 2 & 3:** The organization recognizes the need to support competent P3 managers and provide them with structures to consistently achieve life cycle process goals.
*   **Level 4 & 5:** The organization achieves its goals in a measurable, repeatable way. P3 management is embedded in the organization's way of working and is resilient to external pressures.


### **4.3.1 Maturity Levels 2 and 3**

To reach maturity levels 2 and 3, an organization must demonstrate the corresponding level of capability in all relevant functions and be able to coordinate them within each relevant life cycle process.

#### **Generic Attributes for All Processes**

*   **Goals:**
    *   **Level 2:** The process goals are achieved, though some individual "heroics" may still be present.
    *   **Level 3:** The process goals are achieved through the effective application of the defined process.
*   **Functions:**
    *   **Level 2:** All functions used in the process are performed at capability Level 2.
    *   **Level 3:** All functions used in the process are performed at capability Level 3.
*   **Assurance:**
    *   **Level 2:** The process is checked to ensure it is being performed effectively.
    *   **Level 3:** The process is checked to ensure it is based on tailored organizational standards and is being performed efficiently.
*   **Improvement:**
    *   **Level 2:** Improvements to processes are opportunistic and informal.
    *   **Level 3:** Processes are regularly reviewed, and improvements are formally disseminated throughout the P3 management community.

### **Identification Process**

*   **Goals:**
    *   Develop an outline of the project or programme and assess if it's likely justifiable.
    *   Determine the effort needed to define the work in detail.
    *   Gain the sponsor's authorization for the definition phase.

*   **Level 2 Attributes:**
    *   A separate identification phase is recognizable.
    *   The team is appointed, often based more on availability than competence.
    *   The team accesses informal sources to identify relevant lessons.
    *   A brief is prepared that is sufficient for the sponsor to make a reliable judgment.
    *   A definition plan is prepared so the sponsor understands the scope and timescale of the next phase.

*   **Level 3 Attributes:**
    *   A centrally defined process for identification exists and is tailored to the work.
    *   The team includes resources with the necessary technical competencies.
    *   The team researches the organization's formal records for lessons learned.
    *   The brief conforms to tailored organizational standards, and the decision to run the work as a project or programme is objective.
    *   The definition plan conforms to tailored organizational standards.


*(This structured format is applied to all subsequent processes, including Sponsorship, Definition, Delivery, Development, Boundaries, Closure, Benefits Realisation, Governance, Management, and Co-ordination, detailing their goals and Level 2/3 attributes as provided in the original text.)*


### **4.3.2 Maturity Levels 4 and 5**

To reach these advanced levels, an organization must be able to quantitatively assess its performance and use this information for continuous improvement.

### **Maturity Level 4: Quantitatively Managed**

The guiding principle of Level 4 is that performance is measured quantitatively. The organization moves from focusing on being **effective** to becoming more **efficient**. Assessment at this level uses four high-level indicators.

*   **Level 4 Attributes:**
    *   **P3 Delivery Performance:** A specific body (like a PMO or board) is accountable for the performance of all projects, programmes, and portfolios. Delivery is quantitatively measured and recorded.
    *   **Communities of Practice:** A formal community of practice exists for P3 management, responsible for defining and measuring performance criteria.
    *   **Knowledge Management:** The knowledge management system records quantitative performance data and can be used to identify strengths, weaknesses, and trends.
    *   **Learning and Development:** L&D programs include formal assessments to quantify collective levels of knowledge and performance, ensuring a return on investment.

### **Maturity Level 5: Optimizing**

The guiding principle of Level 5 is that performance metrics are actively used to continuously improve the delivery of projects, programmes, and portfolios. This improvement can be incremental or come from significant innovation.

*   **Level 5 Attributes:**
    *   **P3 Delivery Performance:** The body responsible for P3 delivery is focused on continuous improvement and has the authority to influence the organizational environment outside of the core P3 domain.
    *   **Communities of Practice:** The community is actively involved with external groups, benchmarking performance, identifying innovative approaches, and implementing changes to the organization's systems.
    *   **Knowledge Management:** The system is used to identify areas for improvement and track the effects of changes made to systems and processes.
    *   **Learning and Development:** L&D programs include formal Continuing Professional Development (CPD) processes, where individuals are expected to take responsibility for their own development.
