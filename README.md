# Praxis Framework

**Part 4**  
  
Capability maturity

4.1 Overview

The purpose of a capability maturity model is to provide guidance in the development of an organisation’s ability to deliver projects, programmes and portfolios effectively and efficiently. This can be viewed in two ways: internally or externally.

Viewing capability maturity internally is simply about developing the organisation’s ability so that more projects and programmes deliver their objectives (effectiveness) and less investment is wasted (efficiency). A large proportion of the benefit of developing capability maturity for internal purposes is achieved simply by examining internal processes and making sure they are embedded in the culture of the organisation. Even a poor or inappropriate maturity model can act as a catalyst for this improvement, although the more appropriate the model the greater the stability and effectiveness of the resulting improvement.

Viewing capability maturity externally concerns the reassurance of stakeholders. For example, where a customer is about to invest in a project or programme that is to be delivered by a third party, they will be more confident in the performance of a third party that has demonstrably achieved a high level of capability maturity. This external view implicitly requires the capability maturity of different organisations to be compared; i.e. they should have been assessed against the same model.

Clearly, the best use of capability maturity would be where organisations were assessed against the same model for external purposes but there was sufficient flexibility within that model to account for the difference in context of each organisation’s P3 management.

The underpinning principle of Praxis is that P3 management comprises a broad set of components that are assembled and tailored to suit the context of each unique piece of work. The Praxis capability maturity model aims to be flexible enough to be adaptable to different contexts while being consistent enough to allow comparison between different organisations.

The high-level attributes in the capability descriptions should be read in conjunction with the corresponding function, particularly when interpreting the attributes in the context of the difference between projects, programmes and portfolios.

This is achieved by setting the attributes that describe different levels of maturity at a fairly high level. These attributes are supplemented with advice on their application. The result is not dissimilar to the approach taken by ISO 9000, where each organisation can develop a quality system to suit its own context but, provided the quality system aligns with the ISO 9000 principles, it can still be accredited to a universally accepted standard.

The Praxis maturity model adapts the principles of the CMMI® model by applying separate measures for capability and maturity. Figure 4.1 illustrates the matrix of capability and maturity; only a sample of the functional framework is shown.

**Figure 4.1 The matrix of capability and maturity**

The capability side of the model follows the structure of the functional framework, so that capability can be developed and assessed on a function-by-function basis. An organisation will identify the functions that are appropriate to its context and develop its capability accordingly.

Maturity is achieved by developing capability and then implementing the life cycle processes that apply the functions in an integrated and co-ordinated way. Maturity is increased by developing capability in the relevant functions and then embedding the appropriate methods (project, programme or portfolio).

To aid with improvement, Praxis describes each function using a set of indicators. For each indicator, attributes are described that illustrate the different levels of capability. Because the fundamental principles of managing functions are very similar a large proportion of the indicators and attributes are common to all functions. These are collected together as the generic goals of capability. Indicators and attributes that relate to specific goals are then described for each function.

Maturity levels are described for each life cycle process. This does not imply that an organisation’s maturity can be defined for individual processes. An organisation will tailor its overall life cycles according to the context of its projects, programmes and portfolios. Maturity is then judged to be the level achieved in all the appropriate processes, as shown in Figure 4.2.

**Figure 4.2 Maturity relationships**

The capability maturity model derives its structure from [Parts 1](part01.xhtml) (Knowledge) and [2](part02.xhtml) (Method). In return it describes a series of attributes that describe a standard development path for functions and processes.

Capability and maturity at level 2 require competent people so the competencies in Praxis ([Part 3](part03.xhtml)) are pitched at this level. The maturity model provides an organisational context for the development of individual competencies.

4.2 Capability

To reach a level of capability for a function, the organisation must achieve the appropriate generic goals as they relate to the function, as well as the specific goals of the function. The goals are cumulative; for example, to reach level 3 in risk management the organisation must have achieved the generic goals and risk management specific goals at levels 2 and 3, as demonstrated through the attributes listed.

Specific attributes are only described for levels 2 and 3:

● **At level 0** The function is rarely, if ever, performed in a way consistent with its description in [Part 1](part01.xhtml). This level represents a lack of formal P3 management.

● **At level 1** The function achieves its goals in an ad-hoc manner. This is the key factor regardless of any specific attributes. Level 1 represents an organisation that manages to achieve goals through the work of a few talented individuals.

● **At level 2** The goals are generally achieved using competent people as described in [Part 3](part03.xhtml). P3 management is effective but could be more efficient.

● **At level 3** The organisation co-ordinates P3 management to achieve efficiencies and ensure that good practice is consistent and embedded in the organisational culture.

**4.2.1 Generic goals**

**_Level 2_**

● Establish an organisational policy for performing the function

● Develop and maintain a plan for the function

● Provide sufficient, competent resources for performing the function

● Assign responsibility and authority for performing the function

● Monitor and control the function

● Perform assurance of the function.

**_Level 3_**

● Establish centrally defined procedures and practices

● Tailor procedures and practices to suit the context

● Perform independent assurance of the function

● Collect and utilise lessons learned.

**_Generic attributes_**

****| **Level 1** | **Level 2** | **Level 3**  
---|---|---|---  
**Description** | The function is either not performed or is only partially performed. Where it is partially performed, the approach is ad hoc and succeeds through individual effort. | An organisational policy exists that requires the function to be performed. The function is performed by competent people and plans exist for how the function will be performed. The procedure is monitored and controlled. | The plan for performing the function is based on a centrally defined approach that is tailored for each project, programme and/ or portfolio. Lessons learned are collected and utilised.  
**Indicators** | **Level 1 attributes** | **Level 2 attributes** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Roles and responsibilities** | No formal responsibilities are assigned for the function. | Role descriptions contain responsibilities for the function. | Role descriptions conform to organisational standards, tailored to the context. Statements of authority and accountability are documented.  
**Information management** | There is some ad-hoc documentation relating to the function but it is incomplete. | There is sufficient documentation relating to the function. | All documentation is based on organisational standards, has been tailored to the context of the work and is under configuration control.  
**Assurance** | The function is not assessed for the achievement of the specific goals. | The function is checked to ensure that it is being performed effectively; i.e. that the specific goals are being met. | The function is independently checked to ensure that it is based on organisational standards, has been tailored to the context of the work and is being performed effectively throughout the life cycle.  
**Budget** | There is no identified budget for performing the function. | Budgets exist for all aspects of the function. | Budgets exist and include costs that have been estimated according to organisational standards.  
**Interfaces** | The interfaces between this and other functions are not understood. | The interfaces between this and other functions are understood and documented. | The interfaces between this and other functions are understood, documented and acted upon in a consistent manner.  
**Plan** | There is some evidence of relevant tools and techniques being used but no formal procedures are applied. | A management plan exists for the performance of the function. | The management plan is based on an organisational standard with adjustments to suit the context of the work. This is continually reviewed throughout the life cycle.  
**Initiate** | Members of the management team are competent in the function. | All roles that may be involved in the function include appropriate responsibilities and performance criteria in their descriptions.  
**Specific goals** | The procedural attributes designed to achieve the specific goals of the function are described in sections 4.2.2 to 4.2.14.  
  
**4.2.2 Assurance**

Assurance should:

● review management planning

● monitor effectiveness of functions and processes

● give stakeholders confidence that the work is being managed effectively and efficiently.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The primary concern of assurance at level 2 is to confirm that the P3 management team is applying good practice to the management of the work. The assurance resources may not be sufficiently experienced to challenge the management team about the processes, procedures, techniques and documentation used. Note: assurance is a generic attribute of all functional capabilities. No individual function can be claimed to be at level 2 unless assurance is at level 2. At level 3 the assurance resources should be able to critically review the processes, procedures, techniques and documentation used by the management team. This review will include comparison with organisational standards and lessons learned from previous projects and programmes. There will be particular emphasis on how the management team has tailored the organisational standards to its own context. The assurance reviews will also check that new lessons learned are being recorded and input to the knowledge management function. Stakeholders will be consulted to determine their levels of confidence in the management of the work. Note: assurance is a generic attribute of all functional capabilities. No individual function can be claimed to be at level 3 unless assurance is at level 3.  
---|---|---  
**Process** | The overall management of a project, programme or portfolio is reviewed to ensure it is fit for purpose. This includes life cycle-based processes and organisation structure.  
**Planning** | The existence of effective management plans is checked.  
**Control** | Quality control activities and results are reviewed to ensure plans are being implemented.  
**Report** | The results of assurance are communicated to stakeholders.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Process** | The overall management of a project, programme or portfolio is reviewed to confirm that it accords to organisational standards and has been effectively tailored to match the context of the work.  
**Planning** | Management plans are reviewed against organisational standards and the context of the work. An independent review is conducted of whether all appropriate management plans exist.  
**Control** | The use of quality control results to record and refine lessons learned is reviewed. An independent review is conducted of whether all appropriate control documentation exists.  
**Report** | The assurance management plan is discussed with stakeholders and regular updates ensure high levels of confidence in the management of the work.  
  
**4.2.3 Support**

Support should:

● provide administrative support to P3 managers

● support the governance of P3 management

● provide specialist technical support

● conduct assurance.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | There is a multitude of ways in which a support infrastructure can be constituted. It would be misleading to suggest that one set of indicators and attributes represents good practice in P3 support. More than any other, this capability should be seen as a starting point for the development of a capability that matches the way support is constituted in any given organisation.  
---|---|---  
**Administrative support** | Resources are available to provide assistance that allows P3 managers to spend more time on management rather than administration.  
**Support of governance** | Resources are available to assist in the development of management plans and maintain lessons learned.  
**Technical support** | Technical specialists in different P3 management functions are available to provide advice and guidance.  
**Assurance** | Resources are available to conduct assurance reviews and audits.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Administrative support** | Support offices are constituted at appropriate levels for projects, programmes and portfolios within the host organisation.  
**Support of governance** | Support offices provide assistance in the development of the discipline and profession of P3 management.  
**Technical support** | Technical specialists are integrated into P3 management teams as experts in specific functions.  
**Assurance** | Assurance resources provide consultative support to P3 management teams who need to act on the findings of assurance reports.  
  
**4.2.4 Organisation management**

Organisation management should:

● design an organisation appropriate to the scope of work to be managed

● identify and appoint members of the management team

● maintain and adapt the organisation throughout the life cycle.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | At level 2 members of the management team are often assigned based purely on availability rather than through a selection process (which is a characteristic of level 3).  
---|---|---  
**Initiate** | An organisation structure is designed, team members are assigned and roles are documented.  
**Maintain** | Ad-hoc and reactive adjustments are made to the management team.  
**Close** | Members of the management team are released back to business as usual.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Initiate** | A procedure is followed that identifies potential team members and adheres to an appropriate selection process.  
**Maintain** | The organisation is formally reviewed at appropriate points in the life cycle with structure adapted and roles adjusted as necessary. New appointments follow the selection process.  
**Close** | The performance of management team members is reviewed and communicated back to line managers.  
  
**4.2.5 Stakeholder management**

Stakeholder management should:

● ensure that the views and attitudes of all stakeholders are understood

● influence stakeholders to be supportive of the work wherever possible

● maximise the impact of supportive stakeholders

● minimise the impact of unsupportive stakeholders.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The underlying techniques of stakeholder management are not greatly affected by the setting of the work. At level 2, stakeholder management is deemed adequate if the key stakeholders are identified and communications are sufficient to keep them engaged. It is recognised that some less influential stakeholders may be missed and the focus will be on minimising the impact of unsupportive stakeholders rather than maximising support from supportive stakeholders. The management team provide the resource for engagement and may not always encourage supportive stakeholders to influence unsupportive stakeholders. At level 3, stakeholder management is comprehensive. The identification of stakeholders is thorough and covers both supportive and unsupportive stakeholders equally. Stakeholder information is regularly updated and appropriate people from outside the management team are utilised to engage with stakeholders. Communications are also thorough and all appropriate channels are used to maximum effect.  
---|---|---  
**Identify** | Key stakeholders are identified and documents exist with adequate information to achieve specific objectives.  
**Assess** | Stakeholders are assessed for interest and influence, and the results are documented.  
**Plan communications** | Communications are planned and communication activities are adequately resourced.  
**Engage** | Stakeholders are engaged according to the communications plan.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Identify** | A range of techniques is utilised to ensure all stakeholders are identified. Stakeholder checklists are available derived from lessons learned.  
**Assess** | Stakeholders are assessed using consistent techniques in accordance with the management plan. Standard documentation is adapted to suit the context.  
**Plan communications** | Communications are planned according to organisational policies that have been adapted as necessary. Plans are reviewed throughout the life cycle. All appropriate channels of communication are utilised; supportive stakeholders with appropriate seniority are available and assigned to communication activities.  
**Engage** | Stakeholders are engaged according to the communications plan. Effectiveness is monitored and results fed back into revised plans.  
  
**4.2.6 Business case management**

Business case management should:

● summarise context and delivery in a single document

● explain the desirability, achievability and viability of the proposed work

● develop the primary document that will be used to support a go/no-go decision at all gates in the life cycle

● update and maintain the business case throughout the life cycle.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | A business case is fundamental to any project or programme, whatever the level of capability maturity. There has to be a good and demonstrable reason for investing in the work. For that reason, the differences between level 2 and level 3 capability are, at first sight, quite subtle. The principal differences are the amount of background information given (with respect to options considered but not recommended) and the frequency with which the business case is reviewed.  
---|---|---  
**Summarise and present the desirability of the work** | Stakeholder requirements for the chosen solution are summarised to clearly demonstrate why the work is desirable. This always includes the ‘do nothing’ option.  
**Summarise and present the achievability of the work** | Planning is performed to level 2 capability and delivery documentation for the chosen solution is summarised to clearly demonstrate how the work is achievable.  
**Summarise and present the viability of the work** | Investment appraisal is performed to level 2 capability and the results summarised to clearly demonstrate the viability of the work.  
**Update the business case** | The business case is reviewed, updated and used to support key decision points.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Summarise and present the desirability of the work** | Stakeholder requirements in relation to all solutions considered are summarised. This clearly demonstrates why the work as specified is the most desirable approach.  
**Summarise and present the achievability of the work** | Planning is performed to level 3 capability and delivery documentation for the chosen solution is summarised to clearly demonstrate how the work is achievable.  
**Summarise and present the viability of the work** | Investment appraisal is performed to level 3 capability and the results summarised to clearly demonstrate the viability of the work.  
**Update the business case** | The business case is under constant review and issues that will potentially impact the business case are forecast in advance.  
  
**4.2.7 Control**

Control should:

● review performance against baselines

● evaluate the effect of actual performance on future plans

● take action as required to achieve planning targets or agree revised targets.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | All functions of a project, programme or portfolio must be controlled. The key difference between level 2 and level 3 capability is the degree to which data from the functions is combined to provide a more integrated approach.  
---|---|---  
**Monitor performance** | Performance of key delivery functions is monitored (e.g. delivery schedule, scope and cost). Reports are prepared and communicated to relevant members of the management team.  
**Assess performance** | Performance is assessed on a function-by-function basis (e.g. Gantt based slip charts for schedule impact).  
**Corrective action** | Corrective action is taken on a function-by-function basis with escalation being ad hoc.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Monitor performance** | Performance of all delivery functions is monitored (e.g. communications; consideration of change requests). Integrated reports are prepared and communicated to relevant members of the management team.  
**Assess performance** | Performance is assessed on an integrated basis (e.g. earned value analysis combining schedule and cost).  
**Corrective action** | Corrective action is taken on an integrated basis with escalation being based on tolerances and clear escalation procedures. Exception plans are formally assessed and authorised or the work terminated.  
  
**4.2.8 Information management**

Information management should:

● capture data accurately and consistently

● develop usable information from raw data

● maintain information securely and accessibly during its useful life

● support effective decision making and communication.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The need for assessing capability in information management is less about the inherent complexity of the work and more about its external environment. A large and highly complex piece of work may be very open and straightforward from an information point of view, whereas a small project may be commercially sensitive and in need of careful information management. In an environment where security is important it may be a necessity to have level 3 maturity in information management – nothing less would be adequate.  
---|---|---  
**Collect and create data** | All necessary data is collected or created.  
**Document and store information** | Data is presented as information that supports decision making processes and keeps stakeholders informed. Version control and ownership of documents is clear.  
**Access and disseminate** | Documentation is accessible but controlled. Dissemination is recorded and traceable.  
**Archive** | Documents are archived when no longer required.  
**Destroy** | Destruction of information is ad hoc unless required for contractual or legal reasons.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Collect and create data** | All necessary data is collected or created in a demonstrably consistent manner.  
**Document and store information** | Presentation standards are implemented across all documentation. Key documents are subject to full configuration management. Systems exist to support workflow, secure storage and backup.  
**Access and disseminate** | Levels of access are defined and controlled. There are systems in place to manage authorisations and check dissemination before release.  
**Archive** | Documents are archived when no longer required but document histories are retained.  
**Destroy** | Storage is periodically reviewed and unnecessary documentation destroyed.  
  
**4.2.9 Scope management**

Scope management should:

● identify stakeholder wants and needs

● specify outputs, outcomes and benefits that meet agreed requirements

● maintain scope throughout the life cycle.

**Indicators** | Level 2 attributes | This scope management capability summarises the capabilities for the functions that make up scope management. As it stands this capability is suited to an organisation that runs less complex projects that include benefits management. In situations where an organisation does not operate all the scope management functions (e.g. a contracting organisation) or where scope is complex (e.g. business change programmes), it will be better to use the relevant individual scope management functions.  
---|---|---  
**Manage requirements** | Requirements are captured from key stakeholders.  
**Develop solution** | A solution is developed from the documented requirements.  
**Implement solution** | Change requests are logged and assessed with results communicated to the requesting stakeholder. Version control of products is maintained.  
**Manage benefits** | Benefits are identified, documented and their implementation is planned.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Manage requirements** | A variety of techniques are used to capture requirements from all stakeholders, fully analysed and baselined.  
**Develop solution** | There is evidence that a range of solutions has been considered and the specification is thorough.  
**Implement solution** | Change requests are logged and all aspects of their impact on the work thoroughly assessed. Responsibility for change approval is clearly defined and budgets allocated. Where appropriate the development of products is recorded within a configuration management system.  
**Manage benefits** | Standard format profiles exist for benefits and dis-benefits. Quantitative metrics are used to confirm the achievement of benefits.  
  
**_Requirements management_**

Requirements management should:

● ensure that all relevant stakeholders have the opportunity to express their wants and needs

● reconcile multiple stakeholder requirements to create a single viable set of objectives

● achieve stakeholder consensus on a baseline set of requirements.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | At level 2 requirements management this may be more focused on responding to stakeholders who actively involve themselves in the procedure. As a result some less proactive stakeholders may be missed, resulting in some complexity being missed in the early stages. It could also be the case that less influential stakeholders are not involved and some others may not have full confidence in the procedure. At level 3 the input from proactive stakeholders will be the starting point for the involvement of less active stakeholders by the management team. Appropriate techniques could include surveys and benefit identification workshops. This may also be illustrated by the implementation of structured requirements management techniques such as value management.  
---|---|---  
**Capture** | Key stakeholders are consulted about requirements.  
**Analyse** | The viability of all requirements is assessed.  
**Consult** | Where necessary, clarification is sought and feedback provided to stakeholders.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Capture** | All requirements are captured from appropriate stakeholders using a range of techniques. Stakeholders have confidence that their wants and needs will be considered fully and fairly.  
**Analyse** | The implications of stakeholder wants and needs are fully understood with gaps, overlaps and conflicts removed.  
**Consult** | All appropriate stakeholders are consulted. The best possible level of consensus is achieved and documented in a set of well specified baseline requirements.  
  
**_Solutions development_**

Solutions development should:

● evaluate baseline requirements and alternative solutions to achieve them

● select the optimum solution

● create a specification for the solution.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | At level 2 the management team may focus on the more obvious solutions that can be assessed more quickly using existing knowledge, expertise and/or technology. At level 3 more time is spent on considering less obvious or more innovative solutions. This may be illustrated by the implementation of structured requirements management techniques such as value management.  
---|---|---  
**Evaluate and select** | Alternative solutions are evaluated.  
**Assess value improvements** | There is consideration of how value may be optimised.  
**Produce specification** | Comprehensive specifications exist.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Evaluate and select** | A range of alternative solutions is fully evaluated, including innovative approaches.  
**Assess value improvements** | A range of formal value improvement techniques is applied in order to arrive at the preferred solution.  
**Produce specification** | Specifications are complete, thorough and appropriate to the planned development method.  
  
**_Benefits management_**

Benefits management should:

● define the benefits and dis-benefits of the proposed work

● establish measurement mechanisms

● implement any change needed in order to realise benefits

● measure improvement and compare it with the business case.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | As is the case with all references to benefits, dis-benefits are deemed to be covered as well. The complexity of the benefits management function is a defining factor in deciding whether a piece of work is a project or a programme. On projects where there is a simple relationship between a small number of outputs and a benefit, level 2 will be perfectly adequate. At level 2, identification of new benefits during the life cycle may not be comprehensive. Where there is a many-to-many relationship between multiple outputs and benefits the work will most likely be run as a programme and level 3 capability will be more appropriate.  
---|---|---  
**Quantify** | Benefits are quantified and documented. There is evidence supporting the estimates of benefit quantities.  
**Value** | Financial benefits are valued and documentation shows the reasoning behind the valuations.  
**Plan benefits realisation** | Plans for realising benefits exist and are updated throughout the life cycle.  
**Realise benefits** | There is some measurement of pre-change metrics but this may be inconsistent. Benefits reviews may be left to individual business-as-usual units.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Quantify** | Full benefit profiles are prepared for benefits. These are reviewed throughout the life cycle. New benefits profiles are produced throughout the life cycle as new benefits are identified. There is a clear link between updated benefit profiles and the business case.  
**Value** | Sophisticated techniques are used to value non-financial benefits and documentation shows the reasoning behind the valuations.  
**Plan benefits realisation** | All benefits realisation activities are included in a separate benefits realisation plan or as a section of the main project or programme delivery plan. These plans are regularly updated and interfaces maintained.  
**Realise benefits** | Metrics affected by change are baselined before change is applied and tracked throughout the realisation period. A full benefits review is conducted on completion and actual net benefit is compared with the original business case.  
  
**_Change control_**

Change control should:

● capture stakeholders’ requests to make changes to scope

● ensure that requests are only approved if viable and achievable

● integrate changes into the existing scope.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Scope change requests can apply to any objective; i.e. outputs, outcomes or benefits. Change control is most easily applied to outputs, and physical products in particular. Where the change control procedure is applied more broadly to benefits there must be evidence that all consequences for business as usual, change management activity and the business case have been considered.  
---|---|---  
**Request** | Change requests are submitted and logged.  
**Review** | All change requests are reviewed against high-level objectives and stakeholders informed of results.  
**Assess** | All change requests that pass the review are assessed.  
**Decision** | A decision is made and documented for all assessed requests.  
**Implement** | All approved changes are implemented.  
**Feedback** | Stakeholders who originate requests are informed of the final decision.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Request** | Change requests are submitted and logged in a consistent format fully describing the nature of and reason for the change.  
**Review** | All change requests are reviewed for consistency with high-level objectives. Changes that are not consistent with high-level objectives are rejected.  
**Assess** | All change requests that pass the review are objectively assessed in detail for their viability, desirability and practicality. Recommended action is documented and submitted for a decision.  
**Decision** | A group or individual has clear accountability and responsibility for the final decision. Decisions for assessed requests are made in a timely manner.  
**Implement** | Approved changes are built into all scope and delivery documentation.  
**Feedback** | Stakeholders who originate requests are kept informed of progress and the rationale behind the decision. All relevant stakeholders are kept up to date with scope changes.  
  
**_Configuration management_**

Configuration management should:

● identify the products that will be treated as configuration items

● support the assessment of change requests and document the results of change control

● maintain the validity of the configuration and the accuracy of the configuration management system.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | At level 2 management documents may not be included in the configuration and audits may be ad hoc rather than planned. The type of management issues highlighted in a status report at level 3 could be, for example, that a small number of stakeholders produce the majority of change requests, or one part of the specification is particularly targeted by change requests. In either case action may be appropriate to address a possible stakeholder issue or weakness in the specification respectively.  
---|---|---  
**Identify** | The configuration covers the key technical deliverables.  
**Control** | Configuration management covers version control and basic configuration records.  
**Status accounting** | Status accounts are produced on an adhoc basis and focus on the statistics of the configuration management system.  
**Verification and audit** | Physical and functional audits are performed.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Identify** | A configuration that fully covers the outputs is identified and indexed. Inter-relationships between configuration items are fully and consistently documented. Key P3 management documents are included in the configuration. The configuration is baselined.  
**Control** | Configuration records are regularly updated with information from change control and quality control.  
**Status accounting** | Status accounts are produced on a regular basis and are used to highlight management issues.  
**Verification and audit** | Regular physical and functional audits are performed and reported against the baseline configuration.  
  
**4.2.10 Schedule management**

Schedule management should:

● determine timescales for the work

● calculate profiles of resource demand

● present schedule reports suitable for different stakeholders.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Scheduling approaches are closely linked to scope complexity, which means there is a wide range of ‘appropriate’ methods. As complexity increases, different modelling techniques may be required to match the needs of different sections of work. For example, programme scheduling will cover a greater breadth and focus on the consolidation and summarisation of multiple project and business change schedules. It is recognised that at level 2 the modelling and scheduling should be adequate but less sophisticated than it could be. It is also likely that scheduling focuses on the activity required to deliver outputs and may not apply the same rigour to management activities such as communication, risk response and procurement. At level 3 the organisation is expected to use approaches that are more than just adequate and introduce sophistication that reduces risk and increases shareholder satisfaction. The management activities involved in areas such as communications, risk responses and procurement should be modelled and scheduled with the same rigour as the production activities and integrated with them. Having built an accurate model of the schedule a level 3 organisation will use it to test alternative scenarios, not only to solve issues but also constantly refine the schedule. Stakeholders will be able to obtain up-to-date schedule information that is tailored to their requirements rather than relying on standard schedule reports.  
---|---|---  
**Identify work** | Work required to deliver objectives is identified and documented appropriately. This is updated regularly with a frequency that matches the scale and complexity of the work.  
**Time scheduling** | Single or multiple models are built that are adequate for the context and complexity of the work. These are periodically updated as the work is monitored and controlled. Time estimates are mainly subjective and only single-point estimates are used. The model is analysed using methods adequate for the context and complexity of the work. Analyses are repeated to reflect progress.  
**Resource scheduling** | Resource estimates are mainly subjective and based on a general knowledge of the types of resource employed. The model is analysed using methods adequate for the context and complexity of the work. Analyses are repeated to reflect progress.  
**Report** | Standard reports are distributed at regular intervals.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Identify work** | Activities required to manage functions are identified and included in the scheduling model.  
**Time scheduling** | Schedules are updated at regular, frequent intervals as the work is monitored and controlled. All technical and managerial activity is included in the models. Time estimates are based on objective data wherever possible. Analyses are repeated to reflect progress and test ‘what-if’ scenarios.  
**Resource scheduling** | Resource estimates are based on objective data wherever possible and on a specific knowledge of the resources employed. The influence of different resources on the schedule is understood. Analyses are repeated to reflect progress and test ‘what-if’ scenarios.  
**Report** | Stakeholders are regularly provided with schedule reports that are tailored to their differing needs.  
  
**4.2.11 Financial management**

Financial management should:

● estimate the cost of achieving the objectives

● assess the viability of achieving the objectives

● secure funds and manage their release throughout the life cycle

● set up and run financial systems

● monitor and control expenditure.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | This financial management capability summarises the capabilities for the functions that make up financial management. This summary capability will typically be more relevant for projects that are entirely funded from a single source and use existing financial control systems. The more detailed subsidiary capabilities should be used where: ● funding is external and/or comes from multiple sources ● the business case requires more sophisticated investment appraisal ● l the scale and complexity of the work requires dedicated financial control systems.  
---|---|---  
**Estimate costs** | Top-down estimates are performed early in the life cycle and refined bottom-up as specifications become available.  
**Investment appraisal** | Simple appraisal techniques are documented in the business case.  
**Secure funding** | Routine sources of funding are confirmed.  
**Develop budget** | An overall budget for the work is documented and progress reports track against this budget.  
**Financial control** | Actual costs are accurate and used to track against budget.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Estimate costs** | Cost estimates are reviewed throughout the life cycle and plans updated.  
**Investment appraisal** | Detailed quantitative techniques are used to assess the viability of the work.  
**Secure funding** | A variety of funding mechanisms is considered and the optimum approach is chosen.  
**Develop budget** | Separate budgets are identified for different aspects of the work. Contingencies and management reserves are used.  
**Financial control** | Financial systems are able to track actual costs against categories of cost as defined in a cost breakdown structure.  
  
**_Investment appraisal_**

Investment appraisal should:

● assess the viability of achieving the objectives

● support the production of a business case.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Level 2 capability is concerned with ensuring appraisal supports go/ no-go decisions with acceptable reliability. At level 3 there should be consistent principles guiding investment appraisal across the range of complexity. Stakeholders will be actively involved in determining the criteria for appraisal and all subjective data will be subject to analysis. The investment appraisal will be regularly reviewed as delivery documentation is updated with progress.  
---|---|---  
**Collect inputs** | Stakeholders are informed of the criteria to be appraised. All objective data is collected. Where subjective data is used it is identified as such and appropriately structured.  
**Appraise** | Appraisal techniques are adequate for the justification of the work.  
**Report** | The appraisal is communicated to stakeholders as appropriate and is the primary input to go/no-go decisions by the sponsor.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Collect inputs** | Stakeholders are involved in determining the criteria to be appraised. All objective and subjective data are collected. Subjective data is quantified wherever possible.  
**Appraise** | Appraisal techniques are sophisticated and cover all aspects of the data collected. Multiple techniques will probably be used to confirm viability from differing perspectives.  
**Report** | The appraisal is continually reviewed throughout the life cycle. There are agreed tolerances for controlling escalation of deviation from baselined appraisal.  
  
**_Funding_**

Funding should:

● determine the best way to fund the work

● secure commitment from the fund holders

● manage the release of funds throughout the life cycle.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The provision of internal funding for less complex projects is normally more straightforward and level 2 maturity is adequate. Level 2 is also representative of circumstances where multiple projects, and possibly programmes, are consistently funded in the same way. Level 3 maturity is more appropriate to external funding of larger projects and programmes where the arrangements are often unique to the specific context. Greater integration between the administration of funds and control of expenditure is required at this level to ensure efficient use of facilities provided.  
---|---|---  
**Identify sources** | Regular funding sources are investigated and qualitatively assessed.  
**Negotiate terms** | Usual terms are accepted with limited negotiation.  
**Administer funding** | Funding is drawn down according to approved budgets and cash flow forecasts.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Identify sources** | All possible sources of funding are investigated and quantitatively compared. The benefits of the chosen funding approach over others are demonstrable.  
**Negotiate terms** | Specialist resources are employed to negotiate optimum terms and conditions.  
**Administer funding** | Systems to administer the drawdown of funds are fully integrated with cost control systems.  
  
**_Budgeting and cost control_**

Budgeting and cost control should:

● determine the income and expenditure profiles for the work

● develop budgets and align them with funding

● implement systems to manage income and expenditure.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | At level 2 a more qualitative approach to estimating is allowable for less complex projects. The key factors are that the detailed estimating is performed and the reserve budgets exist. Actual vs. budget reports may be based purely on total expenditure and not broken down further. At level 3 the management team should be able to report on costs in multiple ways and demonstrate that reserve budgets have been quantitatively estimated.  
---|---|---  
**Refine base estimates** | Cost estimating is performed bottom-up for all aspects of delivery.  
**Estimate reserves** | Sums are set aside for contingency reserve and management reserve.  
**Accounting control** | Cost control systems are able to track actual costs in multiple categories and report these against baseline.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Refine base estimates** | Cost estimates are allocated to categories of cost in a cost breakdown structure.  
**Estimate reserves** | There is a quantifiable link between the risk responses and the contingency budget. Management reserves are based on previous experience and analysis of the specific requirements of the project or programme.  
**Accounting control** | Cost control systems are able to track and report by cost attribute, category and steps in the payment process.  
  
**4.2.12 Risk management**

Risk management should:

● ensure that levels of overall risk within a project, programme or portfolio are compatible with organisational objectives

● ensure that individual risks and responses are identified

● minimise the impact of threats to objectives

● optimise opportunities within the scope of work.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Risk management probably has the broadest range of techniques of all the delivery functions. It is not uncommon for risk management to be over-complicated in relation to the complexity of the work. A key difference between level 2 and level 3 is that techniques are appropriately applied. For example, at level 2 there may be over-zealous identification of minor risks that can reduce the effectiveness of the function even though the goals are achieved. At level 3 better weighting and analysis ensures that response planning is proportionate.  
---|---|---  
**Identify** | There is identification of both threats and opportunities.  
**Assess** | Risk events are assessed in terms of probability, impact and timing.  
**Plan responses** | Risk responses are planned and response activities are adequately resourced.  
**Implement responses** | Risk responses are implemented.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Identify** | A range of techniques is used to identify appropriate threats and opportunities. These are continually reviewed throughout the life cycle.  
**Assess** | Risk assessment is conducted from a number of perspectives, including strategic, operational, commercial and internal to the initiative. A range of qualitative and quantitative techniques is used as appropriate. Overall risk is matched to the organisation’s risk appetite.  
**Plan responses** | Risk responses are planned according to organisational policies that have been adapted as necessary. Plans are reviewed throughout the life cycle. All appropriate response types are utilised and management team members with appropriate seniority are available and assigned to response activities. Responses are developed in line with the organisation’s risk attitude.  
**Implement responses** | Risk responses are implemented in accordance with the risk response plan. Effectiveness is monitored and results fed back into revised plans.  
  
**4.2.13 Change management**

Change management should:

● define the organisational change required to convert outputs into benefits

● ensure the organisation is prepared to implement change

● implement the change and embed it into organisational practice.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Capability in change management cannot be achieved by the P3 organisation alone. Inevitably, it will involve people in business as usual who do not regard themselves as part of the project, programme or portfolio. Level 2 is likely to be sufficient for projects implementing non-complex change. Level 3 is an important goal for programmes with complex objectives.  
---|---|---  
**Assess** | The areas of the organisation that are subject to change are assessed for their readiness to change.  
**Prepare** | Change plans are communicated and stakeholders are influenced to support change.  
**Implement** | Change is implemented in accordance with the organisation’s readiness and change plans. Progress is monitored and communicated.  
**Sustain** | Representatives of organisational areas that have changed are assigned responsibility for supporting and maintaining new management processes and behaviours.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Assess** | The underlying characteristics of the organisation are assessed and the likely reaction to change is predicted.  
**Prepare** | Preparation for change is clearly sensitive to the characteristics of the organisation and takes predicted responses into account.  
**Implement** | Individuals affected by change are supported and the approach to change is amended as work proceeds. There are clear links between the control systems within the project, programme or portfolio and the control systems within the organisational area subject to change.  
**Sustain** | Plans exist describing how change will be supported until it is deemed to be embedded in business as usual. The effectiveness of change is periodically assessed alongside benefits realisation.  
  
**4.2.14 Resource management**

Resource management should:

● determine the best way to resource the work

● acquire and mobilise the necessary resources

● control resources throughout the life cycle

● demobilise resources at the end of the life cycle

● finalise all contractual arrangements.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | This resource management capability summarises the capabilities for the functions that make up resource management. If the project or programme makes use of both internal and external resources, and involves letting contracts for goods or services, it would be more appropriate to use the individual capabilities.  
---|---|---  
**Procure** | A procurement procedure exists to identify suppliers and acquire resources.  
**Mobilise** | Plans exist to show how the infrastructure will be mobilised and how these plans are implemented.  
**Control** | Resource usage is monitored and plans updated accordingly.  
**Close** | Demobilisation is planned.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Procure** | Standard procedures are tailored to suit the context of the work. External resources are acquired through tendering and contract terms are negotiated. The management team works with operational departments to agree service levels for internal resources.  
**Mobilise** | The infrastructure is adjusted throughout the life cycle and mobilisation is performed at the beginning of each stage or tranche.  
**Control** | Plans for consumable resources are reviewed regularly and estimates revised. Capital assets are maintained throughout.  
**Close** | Staff are formally redeployed, the value of capital assets is realised and contracts are closed formally.  
  
**_Procurement_**

Procurement should:

● identify potential external suppliers

● select external suppliers

● acquire commitment to provision of internal resources.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Procurement is something that can, and often is, performed relatively informally. This is especially the case with internal resources. The difference between levels 2 and 3 is the formality with which the procurement is conducted and documented. Formalised procurement is a classic ‘insurance’ activity. It probably will not be valued until something goes wrong. Programme-level procurement is often about economies of scale. This will mean that some procurement responsibility is not devolved to projects and therefore requires high levels of co-ordination at the programme level. In these circumstances, contracts may be ‘framework agreements’ which allow programme-level negotiation with project-level scheduling.  
---|---|---  
**Research** | Research is conducted but is often limited to known suppliers.  
**Tender** | Tendering procedures exist but are informal. The approach is demonstrably legal and ethical.  
**Contract award** | Contract award may comprise a relatively simple exchange of letters.  
**Acquire internal resources** | Internal resources are acquired on an informal basis with negotiations between the management team and line managers being conducted on an ad-hoc basis.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Research** | Thorough research is conducted and may be based on organisation-wide framework agreements.  
**Tender** | Tendering activity follows a formal procedure tailored to the context of the work.  
**Contract award** | Contract award includes formal negotiation of terms and conditions. An audit trail of the procedure is available to demonstrate that ethical, legal and regulatory standards have been met.  
**Acquire internal resources** | The plans for internal resource usage are discussed with line managers in the early phases of the work. Service level agreements formalise the commitment of departments to provide internal resource.  
  
**_Contract management_**

Contract management should:

● support procurement by negotiating terms and conditions

● document contractual agreements

● monitor contractual performance

● conclude contracts.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The difference between level 2 and 3 is not about the quality of individual contracts as they all need to be robust and fit for purpose. It is more about consistency across multiple contracts and the degree to which they are treated as working documents.  
---|---|---  
**Negotiate contract terms** | Standard terms and conditions are in place and deemed to be adequate.  
**Monitor** | Contracts are only considered when a breach is suspected.  
**Conclude** | Contracts are closed with confirmation that delivery is complete and final payment made.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Negotiate contract terms** | Standard terms and conditions are reviewed and, if necessary, amended subject to negotiation.  
**Monitor** | Contracts are reviewed to ensure they remain fit for purpose at key points in the life cycle.  
**Conclude** | Contracts are reviewed and a post-contract report is produced that evaluates performance and makes recommendations for future contracts.  
  
**_Mobilisation_**

Mobilisation should ensure that:

● capital assets are operational and accessible

● facilities are operational and accessible

● delivery team members are competent and capable

● all resources are redeployed, returned or disposed of, at the end of the work.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | On low-complexity projects, mobilisation and demobilisation will often only cover small numbers of internal resources. As scale and complexity increases, this capability may have to cover procurement and disposal of significant capital assets and services. It will link closely with the procurement and contract management capabilities.  
---|---|---  
**Mobilise** | Mobilisation is based primarily on availability.  
**Maintain** | Assets and facilities are maintained on an ad-hoc basis.  
**Demobilise** | Assets are disposed of and internal resources are released back to business as usual.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Mobilise** | All resources are confirmed as being available and effective before being implemented according to plan.  
**Maintain** | Maintenance of assets is planned and reliable performance ensured.  
**Demobilise** | Disposal of assets and facilities is managed to realise full value. The performance of internal resources is reviewed and communicated back to line managers.  
  
4.3 Maturity

Many guides describe five very similarly structured levels in their maturity models. Praxis does not see the growing maturity of an organisation as simply executing each and every process in an increasingly rigorous way. There are more fundamental differences between immature and mature organisations, as shown below.

**Level 0** | Level 0 is simple. An organisation does not formally recognise the existence of projects, programmes or portfolios. Projects may be mentioned in name but individuals simply manage them intuitively and without any formal structure. Since this level represents the absence of P3 management, there is no need to define indicators or attributes.  
---|---  
**Level 1** | At level 1 an organisation recognises projects, programmes or portfolios and may apply some functions and processes. Goals are achieved, but this is usually through individual effort and heroics rather than a formal approach. Once again, there is no need to define indicators and attributes at this level because it simply represents an organisation that runs projects, programmes or portfolios but has not reached level 2.  
**Level 2** | Maturity levels 2 and 3 are defined in the Praxis capability maturity model. These levels represent an organisation that recognises the need to develop and support competent P3 managers and provide them with the structures that consistently achieve the goals of the life cycle processes.  
**Level 3**  
**Level 4** | At maturity levels 4 and 5, an organisation is regularly achieving the goals of the life cycle process in a measurable and repeatable way. These levels describe how the organisation embeds these practices into the organisation’s way of working. Effective P3 management in these organisations is resilient and resistant to the pressures of political, economic and environmental change.  
**Level 5**  
  
**4.3.1 Maturity levels 2 and 3**

This section describes maturity of P3 management at levels 2 and 3.

The characteristics of level 1 are common to all three; i.e. where goals are achieved it is often through individual effort and heroics rather than a formal approach.

To reach maturity levels 2 and 3, the organisation must demonstrate a corresponding level of capability in the relevant functions and the ability to co-ordinate these in each of the relevant life cycle processes.

The generic indicators apply to project, programme and portfolio processes. To reach a level of maturity for programme management, project management of the component projects must be at a similar level.

To reach a level of maturity for portfolio management, programme and project management of the component programmes and projects must be at a similar level.

**_Generic attributes_**

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | **Level 3 attributes**  
---|---|---  
**Goals** | The goals of the process are achieved, although some elements of level 1 heroics may still be observed. | The goals of the process are achieved through effective application of the process.  
**Functions** | All functions used to conduct the processes are performed to capability level 2. | All functions used to conduct the processes are performed to capability level 3.  
**Assurance** | The process is checked to ensure that it is being performed effectively. | The process is checked to ensure that it is based on organisational standards, has been tailored to the context of the work and is being performed efficiently.  
**Improvement** | Improvements to processes and procedures are opportunistic and informal. | Processes and procedures are regularly reviewed; improvements are made as necessary and formally disseminated throughout the P3 management community.  
  
**_Identification process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● develop an outline of the project or programme and assess whether is it likely to be justifiable

● determine what effort and investment is needed to define the work in detail

● gain the sponsor’s authorisation for the definition phase.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | On smaller projects the ‘identification team’ may simply be the project manager (applicable to level 2 or 3). It is not necessary for the name ‘identification team’ to be used as long as there is a team that has responsibility for the goals of the process. At level 2 the identification team may be appointed, based more on availability than technical competence.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | A separate identification phase is recognisable and there is an identifiable mandate that triggers the start of the phase.  
**Appoint identification team** | Responsibilities for achieving the goals of the process are included in management team roles.  
**Review previous lessons** | The manager or identification team accesses informal sources of information to identify lessons that may be relevant.  
**Prepare brief** | A document is prepared that is sufficient for the sponsor to reliably judge whether or not the project or programme will be desirable, viable and achievable.  
**Prepare definition plan** | A document is prepared that is sufficient for the sponsor to understand the scope and timescale of the definition phase.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for the identification phase is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of projects and programmes.  
**Appoint identification team** | Resources with the necessary technical competencies are made available to join or advise the identification team.  
**Review previous lessons** | The organisation’s records enable the manager or identification team to research lessons learned and capture relevant lessons, which are then documented in a lessons log.  
**Prepare brief** | The brief conforms to organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work. There is evidence that the decision to manage the work as a project or programme has been made rationally and objectively.  
**Prepare definition plan** | The definition plan conforms to organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work.  
  
**_Sponsorship process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● provide ownership of the business case

● act as champion for the objectives of the project, programme or portfolio

● make go/no-go decisions at relevant points in the life cycle

● address matters outside the scope of the manager’s authority

● oversee assurance

● give ad-hoc support to the management team.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Sponsors at level 2 tend to be reactive. Although they perform the sponsorship role and process, this is largely done in response to prompts from the management team. Sponsors at level 3 are more proactive. They are involved in the work leading up to major decision points so that they are fully conversant with the information that will be formally assessed. They also make sure that the management team are aware of their requirements in terms of the level of detail and format of information provided. Level 3 sponsors are also active in developing members of the project management team, providing coaching and mentoring to promote the smooth running of the project or programme.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | Sponsors are appointed and are competent in sponsorship.  
**Review request for authorisation** | Sponsors are presented with adequate information when authorisation is required and have sufficient resource to effectively assess that information.  
**Provide management support** | Sponsors are available to the management team as and when required.  
**Confirm closure** | Sponsors are requested to confirm closure and have adequate information on which to base the decision.  
**Review achievement of business case** | Sponsors initiate and preside over a review of the business case at the appropriate time.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | Sponsors adhere to the centrally defined role and the sponsorship process as tailored to suit the context of the work.  
**Review request for authorisation** | Sponsors are involved in the preparatory work leading up to a request for authorisation to ensure that the management team are clear about the sponsor’s requirements.  
**Provide management support** | Sponsors take an active role in coaching and mentoring members of the management team.  
**Confirm closure** | Sponsors are actively involved in preparing for closure.  
**Review achievement of business case** | Sponsors maintain active involvement in the period between the closure of the project or programme and the point at which the business case is due to be reviewed.  
  
**_Definition process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● develop a detailed picture of the project or programme

● determine whether the work is justified

● describe governance policies that describe how the work will be managed

● gain the sponsor’s authorisation for the delivery phase.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | On smaller projects the ‘definition team’ may simply be the project manager (applicable to level 2 or 3). In this case it may well be that the identification and definition processes are combined. If so, this maturity level should be used for assessment purposes as the outputs of the combined process should be the same as for the definition process. It is not necessary for the name ‘definition team’ to be used as long as there is a team that has responsibility for the goals of the process. At level 2 the definition team may be appointed, based more on availability than technical competence.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | A separate definition phase and process is recognisable and the goals are achieved.  
**Appoint definition team** | Responsibilities for achieving the goals of the process are included in management team roles.  
**Define scope** | Documentation is prepared that is sufficient for the management team, stakeholders and sponsor to understand the scope of the work.  
**Preauthorisation work** | If necessary, pre-authorisation work is performed with the agreement of the sponsor.  
**Prepare governance documents** | Documentation is prepared that is sufficient for the sponsor to understand how the work will be managed and assured.  
**Prepare delivery documents** | Delivery documents are prepared that are sufficient for the sponsor to understand all relevant delivery aspects of the work (e.g. scope, timescale and risk).  
**Consolidate definition documentation** | Governance and delivery documentation is combined to enable the sponsor to make an informed decision about progression to the delivery phase.  
**Mobilise** | The equipment, facilities and other resources required to deliver the objectives, or the first stage or tranche of work, are mobilised.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for the definition phase is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of the work.  
**Appoint definition team** | Resources with the necessary technical competencies are made available to join or advise the definition team.  
**Define scope** | Scope documentation conforms to organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work.  
**Preauthorisation work** | The impact of performing pre-authorisation work is assessed and incorporated into delivery documentation.  
**Prepare governance documents** | Governance documentation conforms to organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work.  
**Prepare delivery documents** | Delivery documents conform to organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work.  
**Consolidate definition documentation** | Governance and delivery documentation is combined, rationalised and summarised in accordance with organisational standards with adaptations appropriate to the context of the work.  
**Mobilise** | Mobilisation takes the stage or tranche structure into account to ensure mobilisation is as efficient as possible.  
  
**_Delivery process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● delegate responsibility for producing deliverables to the appropriate people

● monitor the performance of the work and track against the delivery plans

● take action where necessary to keep work in line with plans

● escalate issues and replan if necessary

● accept work as it is completed

● maintain communications with all stakeholders.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | How the process, and therefore this competency, is implemented will depend upon the complexity of the work being managed. Less complex projects will have few work packages while programmes and complex projects will have many. Where there are many work packages, these are likely to vary in terms of their scale and whether they are performed by internal teams or external suppliers. More complex work will require more complex techniques. Whereas Gantt-based slip charts may be adequate in a non-complex situation, other circumstances may require more sophisticated techniques such as earned value management. All these contextual factors must be taken into account when considering maturity for this process. Where the work includes delegated work packages and the use of the development process, the maturity of the two processes should be the same; i.e. the delivery process cannot be at level 3 if the development process is only at level 2.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | The delivery phase is managed separately from definition. Where appropriate the phase is divided into stages or tranches.  
**Authorise work** | Work is divided into packages that are formally assigned to teams with performance criteria.  
**Co-ordinate and monitor progress** | Progress is recorded and its impact is assessed and acted upon. Teams working on different work packages are co-ordinated.  
**Update and communicate** | Documentation is regularly updated and disseminated in accordance with the communications plan.  
**Corrective action** | Exception plans are produced where necessary and work is terminated when a business case is no longer achievable.  
**Accept completed work** | Deliverables are formally accepted by the management team.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for the delivery phase is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of the work.  
**Authorise work** | The impact of new work packages on the performance of existing work packages is assessed.  
**Co-ordinate and monitor progress** | Progress information from multiple work packages is consistent and consolidated. Plans are regularly reviewed and updated information fed back to the work packages.  
**Update and communicate** | Adherence to the communications plan is monitored and controlled. Key documents are subject to configuration management.  
**Corrective action** | Systems are in place to identify the need for corrective action in advance.  
**Accept completed work** | Deliverables are subject to a consistent acceptance procedure including sign-off and handover.  
  
**_Development process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● transfer responsibility for a package of work

● execute the package of work

● transfer ownership of the finished products.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | This maturity should be developed and assessed according to the context in which it is being used. It may be appropriate to have multiple versions, for example: ● where a programme is delegating work to a project this process is effectively a summary of the project life cycle ● where a project or programme delegates work packages to suppliers who perform according to a negotiated contract ● where managers of smaller projects allocate work to internal teams or individuals.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | The formal definition and allocation of work packages to teams, suppliers or individuals is recognised and documented.  
**Accept work package** | Recipients of delegated work formally acknowledge receipt of the work package scope and performance criteria.  
**Perform work** | The team or individuals performing the work are technically competent and provide regular progress updates.  
**Deliver products** | All products are formally handed over with accompanying documentation.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for delegating work packages is centrally defined and tailored to suit the context.  
**Accept work package** | Recipients of delegated work are involved in refining the work package scope and performance criteria.  
**Perform work** | The team or individual performing the work uses monitoring and reporting procedures that are consistent with those used to consolidate progress information at the higher level. There are regular updates from the higher level covering any external influences on the performance of the work.  
**Deliver products** | Product handover is consistent for all work packages across the project or programme.  
  
**_Boundaries process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● conclude a stage or tranche in a structured way

● prepare for the next tranche or stage.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The principles of managing boundaries between tranches and stages are largely independent of the scale and complexity of the work. While stages tend to be sequential, tranches typically overlap so that the activities related to boundaries can be chronologically spread out. This should be taken into account when assessing attributes of tranche boundaries.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | Phase, tranche and/or stage boundaries are recognised and formal approval is sought before commencing new sections of work.  
**Close and review previous stage/tranche** | Key lessons from earlier stages or tranches are documented. Stakeholders are informed of the closure of the previous tranche or stage.  
**Plan next stage/ tranche** | Stages and tranches are planned using progress information from previous work.  
**Assemble documentation** | Documentation is assembled that will enable the sponsor to make an informed decision about the authorisation of the stage or tranche.  
**Mobilise** | Most resources are mobilised at the start of the work.  
**Preauthorisation work** | Work that would significantly delay the work if left until authorisation is agreed and performed.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for managing tranche and stage boundaries is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of the work.  
**Close and review previous stage/tranche** | A formal review of a tranche or stage is conducted. The tranche or stage is formally closed including any necessary demobilisation. Lessons learned are added to the organisation’s knowledge management system.  
**Plan next stage/ tranche** | Performance metrics and lessons learned from previous stages or tranches are used to refine plans for subsequent stages or tranches.  
**Assemble documentation** | Evidence is provided that demonstrates how performance metrics have been used to improve performance in subsequent stages or tranches.  
**Mobilise** | Care is taken to maximise the efficient use of resources by mobilising them on a stage-by-stage or tranche-by-tranche basis.  
**Preauthorisation work** | Pre-authorisation work is planned and controlled to a level consistent with the rest of the work.  
  
**_Closure process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● close a project or programme that has delivered all its outputs

● close a project or programme that is no longer justifiable.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | Activities such as handover will vary in detail depending upon whether performance is subject to contractual terms. Responsibilities for demobilisation will be affected by whether a project or programme is stand-alone or part of a portfolio.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | Projects and programmes are formally closed, with the goals of closure usually achieved.  
**Prepare for closure** | Closure activities, including handover, review and demobilisation, are planned in advance of closure.  
**Hand over** | All deliverables are handed over, with the relevant stakeholders confirming that specifications have been met. Follow-on actions reports may be used to agree actions required to finalise deliverables after closure.  
**Review** | The management and governance of the project or programme is reviewed and a post-project or post-programme review is prepared, with lessons learned highlighted. If appropriate, achievement of the business case is reviewed.  
**Demobilise** | All physical assets are sold, redeployed or hire contracts closed. Contracts for services are closed. Internal human resources are released to their home departments or redeployed to other projects or programmes.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for managing closure is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of projects. Projects and programmes are terminated when no longer justifiable.  
**Prepare for closure** | Specialist resources are available to work with the management team while closure is planned in parallel with project or programme delivery.  
**Hand over** | Stakeholder satisfaction with deliverables is followed up post-handover to confirm that both handover and any follow-on actions were successful.  
**Review** | Lessons learned are consistently recorded and disseminated. Recommendations for the improvement of standard processes and procedures are made.  
**Demobilise** | In the case of redeployment of physical assets or release of internal human resource, demobilisation is performed with the requirements of other projects and programmes in mind and not as an isolated activity.  
  
**_Benefits realisation process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● establish the current state of what is being changed

● co-ordinate the delivery of outputs with the management of change

● ensure changes are permanent

● establish whether benefits have been achieved.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | This process is often seen as being unique to programmes, but where the relationship between outputs and a benefit are non-complex it can be applied through a small extension to the traditional project life cycle. When assessing an organisation’s maturity in realising benefits it is advisable to qualify the maturity level with some explanation of the context in which this has been achieved.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | The need to manage the transition from existing to new modes of operation is recognised and managed.  
**Prepare for transition** | Performance criteria are baselined in accordance with benefits profiles. Changes are communicated and readiness for change is qualitatively assessed.  
**Manage transition** | Competent resources are in place to manage the change. Outputs are formally handed over to operational teams. A support infrastructure is in place.  
**Conclude transition** | New working practices are supported until deemed to be embedded as normal operation. Pre-change systems are decommissioned.  
**Final review** | Final reviews are conducted against authorised business cases.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for realising benefits is centrally defined. This is tailored to suit the context of projects and programmes.  
**Prepare for transition** | Standard approaches exist for the measurement of performance criteria and these are tailored to the context of the work. Readiness for change is quantitatively assessed.  
**Manage transition** | Performance criteria are monitored throughout the transition. New benefits are identified and introduced if viable and practical.  
**Conclude transition** | The impact of the changes is reviewed and related benefit plans are updated. Performance improvements are measured and predictions made with respect to planned benefit value.  
**Final review** | Final reviews are conducted with quantifiable measurement of benefits wherever possible. All qualitative measurements are supported by clear and justifiable assumptions.  
  
**_Governance process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● provide ownership of the objectives of the portfolio

● oversee assurance of the portfolio

● promote the discipline and profession of P3 management.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The principles of governance maturity are the same for a standard or structured portfolio. They will simply be applied in a different context with a structured portfolio having the additional focus of a defined set of strategic objectives.  
---|---|---

**Support the profession** | Communities of practice are set up, ethical standards are established and P3 management is seen as equivalent to other professions within the business.  
  
**_Management process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● assess the suitability of projects and programmes for inclusion in the portfolio

● maintain a beneficial and manageable mix of projects and programmes. **Indicators Level 2 attributes**

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The difference between a standard and structured portfolio is primarily that in a structured portfolio the prioritisation and balancing activities must be aligned with the strategic objectives.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | The portfolio organisation is responsible for selecting, categorising and prioritising projects and programmes. It is also responsible for balancing the overall portfolio.  
**Select projects and programmes** | A board exists within the portfolio that has responsibility for reviewing business cases and making go/no-go decisions.  
**Categorise** | Projects and programmes are categorised according to their main characteristics.  
**Prioritise** | Projects and programmes are prioritised according to simple characteristics such as business return.  
**Balance** | Objectives are defined with regard to the required balance of the portfolio. The portfolio is regularly assessed against these objectives.  
**Indicators** | **Level 3 attributes**  
**Description** | A process for managing the portfolio is defined, implemented and regularly reviewed.

**Prioritise** | Projects and programmes are prioritised according to multiple weighted characteristics, allowing complex analysis of the portfolio.  
**Balance** | The characteristics of a balanced portfolio are defined in inter-related and weighted terms. The portfolio is regularly assessed against these objectives.  
  
**_Co-ordination process_**

The goals of this process are to:

● consolidate information from the component projects and programmes to understand the portfolio as a whole

● monitor the performance of the portfolio against its objectives

● manage the inter-relationships between projects and programmes.

**Indicators** | **Level 2 attributes** | The difference between a standard and structured portfolio is simply that in a structured portfolio the co-ordination activities must be aligned with the strategic objectives.  
---|---|---  
**Description** | The portfolio organisation is responsible for co-ordinating the life cycles of component projects and programmes.  
**Co-ordinate initiation** | The portfolio organisation issues and co-ordinates the issue of mandates. Specialist resources required for identification are coordinated at portfolio level.

**4.3.2 Maturity levels 4 and 5**

To reach maturity levels 4 and 5 the organisation must be able to quantitatively assess its performance and use this information to improve continuously.

The guiding principle of level 4 is that performance is measured quantitatively. In progressing from level 3 to level 4 maturity, an organisation is moving from a focus on being effective to a focus on becoming efficient, while remaining effective.

It would be possible to identify attributes for individual processes at level 4 but the principles of quantitatively measuring performance are common to all processes.

Praxis uses the four high-level functions from [Part 1](part01.xhtml) listed below to assess maturity at levels 4 and 5. These address broad aspects of the setting of individual projects, programmes and portfolios, together with the professionalism of those who deliver them.

In the Praxis approach to assessing capability maturity, these high-level functions are assessed as part of the portfolio management processes.

**Indicators** | **Level 4 attributes** | ****  
---|---|---  
**P3 delivery performance** | A body exists that is accountable for the performance of projects, programmes and portfolios across the host organisation. Delivery of objectives is quantitatively measured and recorded. | The body that ‘owns’ all projects, programmes and portfolios within the organisation can take many forms. It could be a company board, a portfolio board or a specially constituted group such as a P3 management office (PMO).  
**Communities of practice** | A community of practice exists for P3 management. This community has responsibility for defining and measuring P3 management performance criteria. | In smaller organisations a single community of practice covering all of P3 management will suffice. As the complexity of projects, programmes and portfolios increases it may be appropriate to have communities that cover specialist areas such as risk management or assurance.  
**Knowledge management** | The knowledge management system records data from the quantitative measurement of functions and processes. It can identify strengths, weaknesses and trends. | Many knowledge management systems are designed to manage textual information such as lessons learned. At level 4 the system needs to enable the quantitative analysis of performance data.  
**Learning and development** | Learning and development programmes include formal assessments to quantify levels of individual knowledge and performance. | This is not referring to tests or qualifications that develop competent people as they are a requirement of level 2. Level 4 learning and development is about collective assessment to confirm that levels of knowledge and competence are being maintained and the return on investment is understood.  
  
The guiding principle of level 5 is that performance metrics are used to continuously improve the delivery of projects, programmes and portfolios. Continuous improvement can be slow and incremental or achieved in significant steps. The latter will usually come through significant innovation and change to the management processes.

**Indicators** | **Level 5 attributes** | ****  
---|---|---  
**P3 delivery performance** | A body exists that is responsible for the continuous improvement of the delivery of projects, programmes and portfolios across the host organisation. This body has authority in areas within the host organisation that constitute the environment of each project programme or portfolio. | The ability to deliver objectives is often affected by factors outside the core P3 discipline and profession. To achieve continuous improvement the body that ‘owns’ all projects, programmes and portfolios must have some degree of authority in the environment outside the P3 domain.  
**Communities of practice** | The community of practice is actively involved in similar communities external to the host organisation. It is involved in benchmarking, identification of innovative approaches and implementation of changes to the host organisation’s systems and processes. | The community (or communities) of practice will maintain external links to other organisations and professional bodies to identify innovations that may deliver step change in the continuous improvement.  
**Knowledge management** | The knowledge management system is used to identify areas for improvement and track the effect of changes to the host organisation’s systems, procedures and processes. | The knowledge management system may not include analysis tools but must allow interrogation that delivers suitable data to analysis tools.  
**Learning and development** | Learning and development programmes include formal CPD processes. | At this level the organisation will expect P3 managers to take responsibility for their personal development and will track the effort put into CPD.
