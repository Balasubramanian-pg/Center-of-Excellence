- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague language. Clearly define deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities.
- **Legal Review:** Have a legal professional review the SOW to ensure compliance and protection for both parties.
- **Attachments:** Include any relevant attachments (e.g., project plans, technical specifications).
